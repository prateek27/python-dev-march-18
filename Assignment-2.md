1. Define a class which has at least two methods:
    - **getString** : to get a string from console input
    - **printString** : to print the string in upper case.

    Also please include a sample to test the class methods.

    Hints: Use \_\_init\_\_ method to construct some parameters
    
2. Define a class named **Circle** which can be constructed by a radius. The **Circle** class has a method which can compute the area. Also, write methods through which any two circles can be compared using >,<,== operators.

3. Define a class named **Shape** and its subclass **Square**. The **Square** class has an init function which takes a **length** as argument. **Both** classes have an **area** function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.
    
    Hints: To override a method in super class, we can define a method with the same name in the super class.

4. Define a class **Person** and its two child classes: **Male** and **Female**. **All** classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for **Male** class and "Female" for **Female** class and "Unknown" for **Person** class.

    Hints: Use Subclass(Parentclass) to define a child class.
    
5. Go through the available public apis listed here: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
   
    Select any 2 of your favorite APIs and write a python script to:

    - collect data from those APIs
    - save the data in a file (json/txt file)
