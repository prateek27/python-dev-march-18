Assignment (Lecture-1 and Lecture-2)

1. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area. 

2. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers. Go to the editor
    ```
    Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
    Output : 
    List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23'] 
    Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')
    ```

3. Write a Python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.
    ```
    Sample filename : abc.java 
    Output : java
    ```
    
4. Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n + nn + nnn + ... + (n multiplied n times).
    ```
    Sample input : 3
    Output : 39
    Sample input : 4
    Output : 340
    
    ```

5. Complete the given lambda function to check if a string is palindrome or not.
    ```
    is_palindrome = lambda str: <your-expression-here>
    ```

6. Write a Python program to concatenate all elements in a list into a string and return it.
    ```
    Sample input : ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    Output : 'abcd'
    ```
    
7. Write a Python program to print all even numbers from a given numbers list in the same order and stop the printing if any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence.

8. Write a Python function to find all distinct pair of numbers whose product is odd from a sequence of integer values.

9. Write a simple Python program which inputs and stores the data about university students as a list of dictioaries. Your final record structure should look like this:
    ```
     [
         {
             'roll-no': 1211,
             'name': 'Ravi',
             'branch': 'CSE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 202,
             'name': 'Abhishek',
             'branch': 'SE'
         },
         {
             'roll-no': 1202,
             'name': 'Sachin',
             'branch': 'IT'
         }
     ]
    ```
